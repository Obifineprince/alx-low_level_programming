A concurrent hash table or concurrent hash map is an implementation of hash tables allowing concurrent access by multiple threads using a hash function.[1][2]

Concurrent hash tables represent a key concurrent data structure for use in concurrent computing which allow multiple threads to more efficiently cooperate for a computation among shared data.
